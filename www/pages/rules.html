    <h3>The Rules</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Open the packages in numerical order</li>
        <li>Return here after you've opened each gift for more clues</li>
        <li>Decipher the theme that every gift shares</li>
        <li>Solve the puzzle by entering the key</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Don't worry - if you get stuck, the app will help you -- but you're a mystery solving genius (thanks Murder She Wrote)!</p>
