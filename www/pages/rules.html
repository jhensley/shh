    <h3>The Rules</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Open the packages in numerical order</li>
        <li>After you've opened a gift, return to the app</li>
        <li>For each gift there are four cards with information</li>
        <li>Some of the cards provide clues - it's up to you to figure out which ones</li>
        <li>Decipher the common theme between all five gifts - that will be your key</li>
        <li>Solve the puzzle by entering the key</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Don't worry - if you get stuck, the app will help you -- but you're a mystery solving genius (thanks Murder She Wrote)!</p>
